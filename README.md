# ü§ñ Duplicate Question Detector

A Streamlit-based NLP application that detects whether two input questions are semantically duplicate ‚Äî inspired by the [Quora Question Pairs](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs) problem.

## üöÄ Overview

This project uses deep learning (Siamese LSTM architecture) with Keras to classify question pairs as **duplicate** or **not duplicate** based on their semantic similarity.

## üß† Features

- Tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal using **NLTK**
- Vocabulary building and sequence padding
- Trained using a **Siamese LSTM** model
- Deployed using **Streamlit**
- Prediction confidence displayed
- Google Drive support for dynamic model loading via `gdown`
